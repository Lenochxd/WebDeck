# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in the WebDeck project a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone.


## Expected Behavior

Participants in this project are expected to:
- Be respectful and considerate in all forms of communication.
- Provide constructive feedback that focuses on ideas and not individuals.
- Use inclusive language.
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Support others in the community, especially newcomers.


## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable:
- Personal attacks, insults, or discriminatory comments.
- Trolling, harassing, or intimidation in any form.
- Publishing private information (e.g., email addresses) without explicit permission.
- Inappropriate or derogatory comments, jokes, or imagery.
- Disruption of discussions, issues, or pull requests with unnecessary or off-topic messages.


## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
